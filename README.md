**Sanchez brings your dull IR satellite images to life.**

Utilising a full-colour, high resolution, static ~~ándale~~ underlay image, combining it with a single greyscale IR satellite image, and some serious maths, Sanchez will create beautiful images to be proud of.

This could be considered cheating, but this is the approach that NASA used to utilise for older weather satellites. If it's good enough for NASA, it should be good enough for you.

Sanchez can bring colour to full-disc images, but it can also reproject and blend images from multiple satellites - either creating a flat projected image, or by creating a virtual satellite image at a given longitude.

Full documentation with examples of all options is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/nullpainter/sanchez/wiki).
